## Problem Statement
An E-voting system that allows student to register,follow campaigns,commenting and voting their learders in. This will reduce time wastage ,and it will increase transparency to voters because its a real time voting system. Currently students vote using a voting website that is shared by a number of university and its not transparent and it doesn't allow the votes to know their leaders batter.This will reduce the rate of cheating among the students during the voting time.
